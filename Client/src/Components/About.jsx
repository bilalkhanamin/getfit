                On her way she met a copy. The copy warned the Little Blind
                Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a

                around and return to its own, safe country. But nothing the copy
                said could convince her and so it didnâ€™t take long until a few
                insidious Copy Writers ambushed her.
